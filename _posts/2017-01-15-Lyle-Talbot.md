From the wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyle_Talbot#Personal_life) about Lyle Talbot:
> *"She was 20, and he was a 46-year-old past-his-prime actor with a drinking problem. The couple had four children together and remained married for more than forty years until her death in 1989."*

Sunday morning coffee spilled.

EDIT: Wikipedia pilfered the original wording from the article ["Lucky Lyle Talbot" by Bill Peschel](https://planetpeschel.com/2013/01/lucky-lyle-talbot/) which is about the 2012 biography: “The Entertainer: Movies, Magic, and My Father’s Twentieth Century” written by his daughter, “New Yorker” reporter Margaret Talbot.

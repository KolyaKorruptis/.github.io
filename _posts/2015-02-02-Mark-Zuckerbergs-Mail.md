title:  "Mark Zuckerberg's Mail"

A drowning man will clutch at a straw. And I imagine that it must have been with that desperate sentiment with which Mark Zuckerberg sat down and composed this text-only mail to me today. And he was so saddened by this loss that he even forgot it was text-only.

Yeah, right. But I won't budge!&lt;BR&gt;Not this time. I am determined to end my Facebook existence which never really took off, partly because my friends are a pile of conformist airheads who brought me there through subtle peer pressure (Oh! I thought I'd invited you!? Didn't you get the invite? On Facebook!)  No, actually I only created that account so I could access the Facebook chat API through a setup that is too awesome and too difficult to explain here, I'll just say that it includes [Bitlbee](http://bitlbee.org/). And actually that's it. But anyway. Mark Zuckerberg, I drink your tears!
Okay.
I have fallen victim to another addiction that is much more fun and kinda old school, at least it feels old school, because I am listening to [the radioooioioiouuuuiiiehscrrrrrrrtch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxSy4Gcn4z8&feature=player_detailpage&x-yt-cl=85114404&x-yt-ts=1422579428#t=25). Well really I'm listening to podcasts, but that's just a fancy way to hear my favourite radio show right now which is [Sanft & Sorgfältig with Olli Schulz and Jan Böhmermann!](http://www.radioeins.de/programm/sendungen/sanft_sorgfaeltig/index.html) *recordscratch* Yes, these guys save my day now every day. And they might save yours as well, if you understand. Thanks for reading!

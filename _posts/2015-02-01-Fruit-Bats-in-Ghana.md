Fruit bats have gotten a bad rap in Ghana lately because they're made responsible for spreading Ebola. However this is going to change with help of two musicians from Ghana who recorded a rap song highlighting the ecological significance of fruit bats. You can listen to a part of that song [here at 12:10](https://soundcloud.com/zeitwissen/zw-lf-m-nner-gegen-newton). (Does anyone know where to find the full track?) They're not the first ones to tackle the subject. My Little Pony covered fruit bats in a surprisingly sophisticated manner before.

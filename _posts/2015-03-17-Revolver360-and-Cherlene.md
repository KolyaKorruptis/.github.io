I just wanna say that [Revolver360 Reactor](http://store.steampowered.com/app/313400/) is the best shoot em up game I've seen in some time. Possibly quite a long time.

As you probably guessed this two dimensional sidescroller has a 3rd axis which can be controlled by rolling with it. Haha.
The user Zaarock on the shmups.system11.org forums has [put together an excellent summary](http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=49067) covering all the aspects of this game.
I'm just going to add that a game controller is recommended and a free demo can be downloaded from the author's page: [http://crosseaglet.xii.jp/game/R360R/download.html](http://crosseaglet.xii.jp/game/R360R/download.html)

Other than that I have completely fallen for [Cherlene](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2015/021/6/a/cherlene_by_princeofukraine-d8etaz8.jpg)'s country album. And yes, Archer <span style="color:#FF99FF">Vice</span> was miles better than a lot of what came before or after. I'm going to dig for my [Old 97's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcRc7Ng2ui0) albums now to soothe that alt-country fury.

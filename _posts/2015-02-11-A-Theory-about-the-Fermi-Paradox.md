I have a theory about the Fermi paradox: Alien colonisation is taking place and we are a part of it. At some point life was planted on earth with the expectation that we will develop space travel and eventually spread out to other planets. If we ever find ourselves in a situation that a habitable planet has been found but it's just too far away or we have enough already, so we simply send a probe with some eukaryotes there, then we will know. Also that stupid Prometheus movie will finally make some sense!

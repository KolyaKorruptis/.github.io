tl;dw: There's a script she likes with Ripley not on Earth. Maybe it'll become a movie someday.

I guess most people know that the title of Ray Bradbury's novel "Fahrenheit: 451" describes the temperature at which books would start to burn.

To find out, Ray Bradbury didn't burn a book with a thermometer inside. He instead [called his local fire department](https://youtu.be/sLuDOEuwwso?t=660) as he explains in this interview.<br>
The 451° value he was given was rather low and peculiarly specific though. The auto-ignition temperature of paper (ie when heated but not exposed to flames) by recent experiments lies around 480 Fahrenheit. It varies a lot due to type of paper (un/coated), thickness, composition, density, shape (open vs closed book).

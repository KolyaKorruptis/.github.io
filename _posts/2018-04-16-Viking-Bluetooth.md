![:D](../_resources/down.png) Fricking viking runes are on our puters because the guy who designed the protocol was reading a historical viking novel ("[The Long Ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Ships)") at the time.

I hope one day Bluetooth is going to get replaced by a higher bandwidth protocol named Forkbeard. Partly because that's the name of Bluetooth's son, but also because it's so much fun to say.

Forkbeard.

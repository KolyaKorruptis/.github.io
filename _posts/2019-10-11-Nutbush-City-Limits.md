My wife likes to wash our clothes with [Sapindus Saponoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapindus_saponaria) but these have become prohibitively costly in our town.
They call it nutbush city limits.

Ike & Tina Turner's track is set here to a fragment of the film _"Sweet Charity: The Adventures of a Girl Who Wanted to Be Loved"_ [1969] ([imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065054/))

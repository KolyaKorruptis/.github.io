On 13. April 1992 I was still sitting at my computer at 3:20 in the morning when I heard some kind of rumbling. First I thought the cat had opened the door until I noticed the ground vibrating. I ran to the window and saw the row of houses on the opposite side of the street swinging back and forth about 2-3 meters. The earthquake lasted quite long (15sec) but not long enough for me to flee to the street or do anything except watch in amazement.

A postcard arrived today from my godchild in Nepal. It had a flower drawn on it and not much else. The preprint on the front said "To mark the start of our new close relationship". Well, I hope she learns to write. I sent her a little writing book with drawn illustrations and descriptions of my favourite palm trees that I grow and of my talkative cat. Then I wanted to tell her about my job. I ended up explaining that it's like making picture books or newspapers, but on a computer. Some new perspective here.
As far as I know I'm sponsoring her, so her family can afford to build a toilet. But secretly I hope that she will rise through the ranks of rural Nepal and invent a vaccine against cancer. Or at least not get beaten and taken advantage of. It's hard to tell what her life really looks like.

Do you still have a lot of audio CDs? And do you still listen to them?
By a quick estimate I have a about 500 CDs, but they just sit there in a box and a board (the more recent ones). So I've started to digitise - wait that's not the correct word - I started to *back them up* to HD which brings up the choice of the correct format:
Some of them are quite rare, like "In Guz we trust" by Swiss multi instrumentalist Guz. These go to FLAC of course. Others require superior sound quality, like Goldfrapp's "Seventh Tree". But do I really need a FLAC backup of Hole's "Live through this"? Even if I ever felt the need to listen to this album again, won't MP3 suffice? My hearing won't get better and if it's good enough now, why not in twenty years?

And what do I do with these CDs once I have backed them up? I'm far to lazy to flog them on ebay and I like them too much to throw them away. Diary of a hoarder. There was a time when I had to live out of one backpack and it felt great. Fortunately I will get back to that soon.

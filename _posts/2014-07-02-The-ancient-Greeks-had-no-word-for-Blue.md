The ancient Greeks had no specific word for [Blue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue#In_the_ancient_world).
In fact their whole color perception must have been very different than ours. Not for biological reasons but because of how language influences our perception and minds. [This excellent article by Erin Hoffman](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/hoffman_01_13/) on Clarkesworld goes far beyond this curiosity and makes enlightening points about the relations of such diverse phenomena as synesthesia, metaphors, onomatopoeia and our perception of the world.

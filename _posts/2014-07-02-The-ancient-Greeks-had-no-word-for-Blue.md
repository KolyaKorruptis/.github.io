The ancient Greeks had no specific word for [Blue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue#In_the_ancient_world).
In fact their whole color perception must have been very different than ours. Not for biological reasons but because of how language influences our perception and minds. [This excellent article by Erin Hoffman](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/hoffman_01_13/) on Clarkesworld goes far beyond this curiosity and makes enlightening points about the relations of such diverse phenomena as synesthesia, metaphors, onomatopoeia and our perception of the world.

> To a certain extent, we are all synesthetes, and [...] this inherent interconnection between our cognitive functions is intrinsic to the most beloved traits of humanity: compassion, creativity, ingenuity. What, after all, is an idea, but one flash of thought leaping across the mind to suggest novel possibility?

1
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:16,366
THE GIRL FROM TRIESTE

2
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:32,503
What's up with her?
She's drowning!

3
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,928
Push it, come on!
Hurry!

4
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:52,369
Look at that!

5
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,885
Doesn't know how to swim
and still goes out.

6
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,847
Nothing surprises me anymore.

7
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,293
But she's going to make it.

8
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:27,850
Tony, give her
something to drink.

9
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,604
- Can you stand by yourself?
- Yes, thank you.

10
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:39,090
You know
you barely made it?

11
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:42,164
That's true.

12
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:47,118
- Drink, it will do you good.
- Tony, give us also one.

13
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:48,734
One after another.

14
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,414
Where are your clothes?

15
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,807
The sea must have washed them away.

16
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,130
Give me another.

17
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:10,892
Thank you.

18
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:13,669
- Give me a drink as well.
- Of course.

19
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:32,008
I'll leave,
please give me the lobster.

20
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,373
Here you go. Have a good day.

21
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:40,134
You're leaving already?

22
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:47,550
- You were scared, eh?
- Not at all.

23
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,454
It was very beautiful.

24
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:50,890
Beautiful?

25
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:54,466
Yes. Especially
when they rescued me.

26
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,195
It was extraordinary.

27
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:59,458
I felt loved.

28
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:00,808
I felt something.

29
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:03,885
Ciao, Tony.

30
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:05,734
Goodbye, Mr. Dino.

31
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:14,930
If you do not bring me back my plaid
I will notify the police.

32
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:47,565
Hello!

33
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,211
They told me you lived here.

34
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:00,174
Is this your house?

35
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:01,890
Nice.

36
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,968
Yes, I like it too.

37
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,503
These are my drawings!

38
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:15,672
You threw them away, remember.
They are mine now.

39
00:07:15,872 --> 00:07:17,253
No one wants to take them from you.

40
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,772
Tell me one thing.

41
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:22,526
What do you really want from me?

42
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:25,490
Can I come in with you for a moment?

43
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,605
Sure.

44
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:28,688
Sorry, could you hold this for me?

45
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:30,290
- That okay?
- Sure.

46
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:56,091
- It's beautiful here.
- I'm not complaining.

47
00:07:58,055 --> 00:07:59,249
My name is Nicole.

48
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:01,490
So you're French?

49
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:03,613
My mother is French.

50
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:06,973
Dad met her in Paris.
He was a diplomat.

51
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,530
Nicole and further?

52
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,252
I know your name.
Dino, Dino Romani.

53
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,210
Exactly.

54
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:24,132
You make comics?
Like Charlie Brown?

55
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:27,732
Charlie Brown is a character.
The designer is named Schulz.

56
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,806
You're as famous as him?

57
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:33,452
But your drawings are beautiful.

58
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:35,610
It's true.

59
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,533
That's enough for me.

60
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:53,291
So?

61
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:56,025
What do you want to do?

62
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:57,974
Give you back your plaid of course.

63
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:02,845
Nothing else?

64
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:09,292
Don't you want to make love?

65
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,788
I love to make love.

66
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:02,486
Stay beside me.

67
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,450
I like being caressed afterwards.

68
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:46,609
You're thirsty?

69
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:54,253
I will be right back.

70
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:45,806
Hey

71
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:52,774
Who is she?

72
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:54,604
Beauty.

73
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:57,133
Beauty, Nicole.

74
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:58,524
Very pleased.

75
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:02,364
But Beauty, thou hast no face?

76
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:04,213
It is being born.

77
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:05,974
A gorgeous body.

78
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,008
She has no taboo.

79
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:12,974
I want her to be a kind of
symbol of innocence.

80
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:15,890
Provocative, without knowing it.

81
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:17,524
Like me?

82
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:21,131
I said without knowing it.

83
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:24,163
You believe you can see through me, right?

84
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:28,213
It's not difficult.

85
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:40,845
You know

86
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:44,214
Today at the beach
I only pretended I was drowning.

87
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,368
I can swim very well.

88
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:50,606
And you act very well.

89
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,523
- You mock me?
- No.

90
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:55,766
Is this the new game among your friends?

91
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:57,614
No.

92
00:13:58,075 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm doing tests.

93
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,024
Tests?

94
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,285
I make myself drown
like today.

95
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:12,209
Or I lie on the road,
as if I had been hit by a car.

96
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:16,897
Or I simulate suicide with
some sedatives, for example.

97
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:20,888
And if someone comes and tries to
save me, then

98
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,689
I feel loved

99
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:25,148
and regain my identity.

100
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,145
Your identity?

101
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:31,934
Proof that the world
knows I exist.

102
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:36,141
Why do you look at me that way?

103
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,858
I wish she had your face.

104
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:39,333
Who? Beauty?

105
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:42,359
You should pose for me.

106
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,907
I'll be happy with half an hour.

107
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:45,828
Why not.

108
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:48,865
I have nothing to wear.

109
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:51,812
I have a wardrobe full of
women's clothes. Choose one.

110
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:53,891
From your wife?

111
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:55,785
I am not married.

112
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,431
Tony already told me.

113
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,397
But I wanted to hear what you would tell me.

114
00:15:28,535 --> 00:15:30,253
It's best to close the door, no?

115
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:58,643
I did not want to offend you,
forgive me.

116
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,887
But what is it, now?

117
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:08,170
Sorry.

118
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:20,204
Why did you want
to close the door?

119
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:28,213
I want a man who loves me
also when I pee.

120
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:34,694
Whose clothes are all these?

121
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:35,884
Who cares.

122
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,931
Tony told me you lived alone.

123
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:42,208
- And you go soon.
- Tony talks too much.

124
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,694
Is it true you go?

125
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:46,851
Within a few weeks.

126
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,933
You do not like people, huh?

127
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,808
A small dose.
The fewer there are, the better.

128
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:55,406
Me, it's the opposite.

129
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,447
I hate loneliness.

130
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:00,134
Each his thing.

131
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:02,045
Exactly.

132
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:05,007
And you, where you live?

133
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:07,775
In an old villa
near San Justo.

134
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:11,813
There is a garden
with Greek columns.

135
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:14,610
And a big beautiful tree in front.

136
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:16,726
And an army of servants.

137
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:17,765
A cook

138
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:20,571
Butler and four good.

139
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:22,811
Well, you have to be wealthy.

140
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,685
I have everything I want.

141
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,808
And even more!

142
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:31,850
Well, I'll prepare food.

143
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:34,011
It starts when you're ready.

144
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:50,889
Are you ready?

145
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:29,365
Good morning.

146
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:33,246
You remember the girl
who was rescued the other day?

147
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:36,495
- Have you seen her?
- I know who that is.

148
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,450
Surely one of these a looser,
one day here, the other way ...

149
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:45,170
It's not serious. Thank you, anyway.

150
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:56,247
It is immediately to the right
the end of the square.

151
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,208
- Thank you.
- I beg you.

152
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:52,489
I have not found. Where are you?
Nicole.

153
00:21:10,695 --> 00:21:12,572
I did not expect, my darling!

154
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:14,606
- I should know.
- Nothing.

155
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:17,172
But I have an appointment tonight.

156
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,845
Come with me, it is among
The Stanui, you remember?

157
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,133
Annoying but harmless.

158
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,248
No, it tells me nothing.
I just wanted to sleep.

159
00:21:27,215 --> 00:21:29,046
You're home, you know the.

160
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,530
But eat something,
promised?

161
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:32,326
Promised.

162
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:35,004
Hello, my pretty.

163
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:36,850
Have fun.

164
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:39,091
I'll be back before midnight.

165
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:50,846
Hello?

166
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:57,527
You have nothing to say?

167
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:02,771
What is your real name?

168
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:06,768
I found a bracelet
with the initial''C''R d.

169
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:09,250
R is for what?
Rosa? Rita? Renata?

170
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:12,325
So you do not want to talk?

171
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:39,929
Can I come?

172
00:22:42,815 --> 00:22:44,373
- Why?
- I bring you the dress.

173
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:48,086
- Where is she?
- What?

174
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:50,931
The dress.

175
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:53,813
I've forgotten.

176
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:05,931
You forgot something else.

177
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:11,734
D C''R''.

178
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,374
What makes you laugh?

179
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:21,487
R d''C''is the name of the merchant.
I do not call Renata

180
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:24,973
- But Nicole.
- So it was you over the phone?

181
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:43,726
- You have taken the time?
- While you were sleeping.

182
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,409
They are beautiful.

183
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:48,654
It is you who are beautiful.

184
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:51,813
On it, I had
make a horrible nightmare.

185
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:55,768
I do not love Him.

186
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:00,650
I look dead.

187
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:03,525
- You slept.
- Dead I am like that.

188
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:05,890
Tear-La.

189
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,168
The tear, I beg you.

190
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,567
The tear, I say!

191
00:24:18,455 --> 00:24:20,730
You're a funny girl, Nicole.

192
00:24:22,655 --> 00:24:24,611
You also have a surname?

193
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:28,924
That could be.

194
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,733
But I forgot the.

195
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:36,171
I bet you do not believe me.

196
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:38,253
Exactly, I do not believe you.

197
00:24:38,815 --> 00:24:40,214
It's true.

198
00:24:41,055 --> 00:24:43,774
There is so much
I do not remember.

199
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:49,213
When you do not love,
we try to forget.

200
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,649
You do not love?
I think you're beautiful!

201
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:55,245
Because if I want,
I can seduce.

202
00:24:55,735 --> 00:24:57,885
I dressed in real lady.

203
00:24:58,855 --> 00:25:01,528
Tonight I want to go out with you.

204
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:06,324
I can not say no
a real lady.

205
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:15,366
I want you to share a detail.

206
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:16,166
What?

207
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:19,926
The villa which you spoke
would need work.

208
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,328
- Thank you.
- I beg you.

209
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,248
I do not mind ...

210
00:25:30,455 --> 00:25:33,333
It amused me
you do not tell me anything about you,

211
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:35,528
but lie to me more.

212
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,808
This was not a lie,
but a fantasy.

213
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:41,769
You do not like it?

214
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,693
Like that your father?

215
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,694
- The diplomat?
- I never knew my father.

216
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:53,930
This place bores me.

217
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:57,214
It is stifling here.

218
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:24,844
It amuses you?

219
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:27,173
Why? I do not do anything wrong.

220
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,407
No. You're fantastic, I know the.

221
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:36,331
- Shall we?
- If this is your desire.

222
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,686
Justino?

223
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:39,725
Sir?

224
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:45,131
Madam ... no longer hungry.

225
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:49,213
Another time.

226
00:26:49,415 --> 00:26:51,326
Of course, sir. Thank you.

227
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:03,010
Madam, your shoes.

228
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:08,164
- Good evening.
- Bye.

229
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:11,325
You saw how I am hard.

230
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,331
You're right, I still tremble.

231
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:18,845
You had your shot prepared, eh?

232
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:23,369
I do not anticipate that I will
one minute to the other.

233
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:27,608
Needless to search.

234
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:30,850
If they stop,
you do not have your papers?

235
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:33,166
I have never on me.

236
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:36,053
- A relative of yours?
- Who?

237
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,734
Giuliano Tomita.

238
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:46,288
What is wrong with you?

239
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:50,124
- Looks like you're the police!
- Come, calm yourself.

240
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:52,574
Give me a cigarette.

241
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:02,689
It's your brother?

242
00:28:02,895 --> 00:28:05,648
I have neither brother nor sister,
if you want to know.

243
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:07,811
- Your husband?
- I am not married.

244
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:10,654
- But I'll be in the month.
- Congratulations.

245
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,688
Now you know
why I behave this way.

246
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:14,884
Who is then?

247
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:17,449
His name is Michele.

248
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:19,572
I met him at university.

249
00:28:19,775 --> 00:28:21,333
- At the university?
- Right.

250
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,924
I study English literature,
I am preparing my thesis.

251
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:28,770
I also have a job,
for your information, archivist.

252
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,969
And then there was Francesca
studying architecture.

253
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:34,166
Who?

254
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,331
- Francesca.
- Who is it?

255
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:39,727
It is the former girlfriend Michele.
She loves him still.

256
00:28:40,215 --> 00:28:43,446
- We saw all three together.
- If you're going ...

257
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,290
You do not believe a word
what I said?

258
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:48,247
- Should I?
- Why not?

259
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:52,331
But still ...
if you're in love with Michele,

260
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:54,605
What are you doing with me?

261
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:58,215
I did not say
I was in love with him.

262
00:28:59,255 --> 00:29:00,404
I said that I married.

263
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:02,244
It's true.

264
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:06,489
- He knows you love him?
- Sure.

265
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:10,005
Why not marry
Francesca? She, she loves him.

266
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:12,452
- Because he loves me.
- But you do not love her.

267
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:14,044
It's you that I love!

268
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:40,924
You're funny when you sleep.

269
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:45,014
I wanted to know your reaction
seeing that I had disappeared.

270
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:48,414
I wondered
if you seek me.

271
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:50,454
I love you. Nicole.

272
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,010
If you come,
wait for me, if you like.

273
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:01,568
The door is open.

274
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:23,366
Tomita? It's here.

275
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:25,851
- Where?
- On the first floor.

276
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:29,893
- I take the stairs?
- Yes. The last door on the right.

277
00:32:43,655 --> 00:32:44,690
Please?

278
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:50,649
- Looking for Miss Tomita.
- You found it.

279
00:32:51,775 --> 00:32:52,525
Nicole Tomita.

280
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:54,931
No, Francesca Tomita.

281
00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:59,767
Who is Giuliano Tomita?

282
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:01,169
It's my father.

283
00:33:03,935 --> 00:33:05,084
It becomes complicated.

284
00:33:05,935 --> 00:33:08,449
You need to get my friend,
Nicole Roselli.

285
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:10,773
This is a big liar!

286
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:13,729
You do not live with it
and a Michele?

287
00:33:13,935 --> 00:33:16,085
- It was there two years.
- Where does she?

288
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:20,529
I've lent him my car
there three months, I do not have the magazine.

289
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:22,453
Nicole is like that.

290
00:33:22,895 --> 00:33:24,613
Yes, I've noticed.

291
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:27,612
She said
she married Michele.

292
00:33:27,895 --> 00:33:28,645
Michele?

293
00:33:29,695 --> 00:33:31,651
But I'm the wife.

294
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:34,974
You're going to marry?

295
00:33:38,855 --> 00:33:40,925
It took you by boat, right?

296
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:42,693
It was me all the air.

297
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,089
This is ridiculous.

298
00:33:45,735 --> 00:33:47,214
You know where it can be?

299
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:50,404
I know the name
one of her friends.

300
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:52,812
I'll try that.

301
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:56,493
It's unbelievable, no?

302
00:33:59,935 --> 00:34:03,769
We are good friends,
yet I know very little about it.

303
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:08,851
But you know Nicole,
it is mysterious.

304
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:13,052
She goes, she comes
Here she is, she is gone.

305
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:16,045
You can not help me?

306
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,086
A phone, an address?

307
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:20,411
- A name?
- I can not help you.

308
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:24,846
Imagine
I do not even remember

309
00:34:25,135 --> 00:34:26,568
The when I met her!

310
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:28,365
Well ...

311
00:34:31,455 --> 00:34:33,411
I've pretty bored.

312
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:35,811
You did not at all disturbed.

313
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:37,130
If you ever see The ...

314
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:40,486
- I tell him that you are looking for the.
- Thank you.

315
00:34:58,295 --> 00:35:00,490
Surprised?
You have not forgotten?

316
00:35:01,455 --> 00:35:03,969
Val ... I have not seen your car.

317
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,685
It is behind I am discreet.

318
00:35:15,975 --> 00:35:17,374
Her name is Nicole?

319
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:23,293
She is very pretty.

320
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:27,610
You take on the cradle
now?

321
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:30,213
As if you did not know!

322
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,247
It does not bother
I still use your home?

323
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,334
How are you, Valeria?

324
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:41,814
I'm doing.

325
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:44,008
You have too much heart.

326
00:35:44,215 --> 00:35:47,287
You deserve to meet
a man who can appreciate you.

327
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,331
I think to seek him, thank you.

328
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:53,611
I forgot ...

329
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:56,250
I lent one of your dresses to Nicole.

330
00:35:56,535 --> 00:35:59,288
- She was naked?
- It would have been amazing!

331
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,774
I'm jaded

332
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:06,012
but with her
I go from one surprise.

333
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:07,887
Did she hang?

334
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:11,485
The roles are reversed,
it will do you good!

335
00:36:12,815 --> 00:36:14,885
I've never been able to hide.

336
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:16,724
Right?

337
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:21,688
What is it advanced me?

338
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,531
All is not over between us?

339
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:45,611
It is you who are mysterious.

340
00:36:46,735 --> 00:36:49,169
I found
a friend who is very dear.

341
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:08,564
Excuse me.

342
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:20,406
Where are the keys to your car?

343
00:37:21,055 --> 00:37:22,249
On contact.

344
00:39:37,535 --> 00:39:38,524
I was alone again.

345
00:39:39,215 --> 00:39:42,252
Me ran away,
I had a drink in a square

346
00:39:42,455 --> 00:39:45,606
I stayed there,
bare legs, raised,

347
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:47,771
Until they noticed me.

348
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:50,694
I felt better, less alone.

349
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:53,728
They will remember me,
exist.

350
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:57,245
These pigs looking at me
I could feel their desire ...

351
00:39:57,535 --> 00:40:00,732
They needed me,
m they loved him somehow.

352
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:04,246
So you are There?
Where have you been

353
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,729
all day?

354
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:08,210
Professor Marin you looking for.

355
00:40:08,415 --> 00:40:11,373
You can still see Him,
He is in his office.

356
00:40:24,295 --> 00:40:25,045
Enter!

357
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:32,166
So?

358
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:35,090
We have often talked about.

359
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,364
Listen.

360
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:41,727
This is not attracting
the attention that you will solve

361
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:44,893
- Your problems, your loneliness.
- What is the solution?

362
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:51,246
In any case, not go to a place
show off ...

363
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:54,533
- Do not show off ...
- Exhibiting my cat?

364
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,766
The reason you do not say?

365
00:40:57,415 --> 00:41:00,373
You're a doctor, you did not
to be afraid of words.

366
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:02,611
Not Words
that scare me,

367
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:04,924
but the use made of it.

368
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:11,689
Why do not you go back
see the man whom you spoke?

369
00:41:12,815 --> 00:41:14,248
I changed my mind.

370
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,125
Why?

371
00:41:17,335 --> 00:41:18,734
He is a liar!

372
00:41:20,095 --> 00:41:21,813
You're wrong.
You did not say ...

373
00:41:22,015 --> 00:41:23,767
I tell him anything.

374
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:26,604
I never know it.

375
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,615
You should stop
out some time.

376
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:38,773
Say one week.

377
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:43,328
You want to punish myself?

378
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:47,133
I just ask

379
00:41:47,415 --> 00:41:48,530
a small sacrifice.

380
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:52,129
Thou must help me.

381
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:55,168
I need to take care of you.

382
00:41:57,255 --> 00:41:59,086
You want to heal, is not it?

383
00:42:00,775 --> 00:42:01,924
More than anything.

384
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:05,651
You do not have the magazine?

385
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:07,493
No sign of her.

386
00:42:08,535 --> 00:42:09,684
I do not believe you.

387
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:14,451
Tell me why
you give yourself this May?

388
00:42:15,055 --> 00:42:16,329
How?

389
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,293
Why are you looking for Nicole?

390
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,814
It's worth the trouble?

391
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:23,773
You know where she is.

392
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,649
You're wrong!

393
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:29,691
Why not tell me the truth?

394
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:31,214
Let me hide you?

395
00:42:31,935 --> 00:42:34,449
Nicole is a whore?
A call girl?

396
00:42:35,015 --> 00:42:37,768
Please, Mr. Romani.
You become insulting.

397
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:40,011
And you, what are you? Madam?

398
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:42,243
Where is Nicole?

399
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:46,490
It is better that you leave,
you're drunk.

400
00:42:53,295 --> 00:42:55,365
It's the least of my worries.

401
00:42:57,895 --> 00:42:58,486
Good evening.

402
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:00,847
So I lied.

403
00:43:01,055 --> 00:43:03,091
I told
that I married Michele.

404
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,489
I'm really mad.

405
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:06,494
But I really like it.

406
00:43:07,455 --> 00:43:10,527
This is the first time
I feel this feeling.

407
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:12,691
For him I want to heal.

408
00:43:12,895 --> 00:43:14,613
I do not want to hurt him.

409
00:43:14,935 --> 00:43:16,653
We made a pact.

410
00:43:17,535 --> 00:43:19,730
I would go out just a few hours.

411
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:23,087
I can not stay like that
I've got the track

412
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,650
I explain, at least.

413
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:27,334
Then you let yourself heal?

414
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:31,044
I promise.

415
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:33,532
The You know, I want to heal.

416
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:35,254
And you will be cured.

417
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:46,492
You think someone
who knows nothing about me

418
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:51,167
may suspect
I have the sick mind?

419
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:56,606
It is beautiful, your spirit.

420
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,333
Wait, dammit!

421
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:03,328
Where were you like that?

422
00:46:04,335 --> 00:46:05,768
I could not find your house.

423
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:12,685
You're Here!

424
00:46:14,615 --> 00:46:15,809
You came.

425
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:33,927
I've just missed?

426
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:36,886
I did that get you.

427
00:46:38,415 --> 00:46:39,006
Where?

428
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:42,609
I went everywhere, Miss Roselli.

429
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:49,969
- Who told you my name?
- Some Francesca

430
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:52,725
who will marry a certain Michele.

431
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:55,844
You've met?

432
00:46:57,095 --> 00:46:57,686
No.

433
00:46:58,535 --> 00:46:59,809
What did she say?

434
00:47:00,975 --> 00:47:02,169
Not much.

435
00:47:03,455 --> 00:47:05,173
No more than your friend Clara.

436
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:07,570
Many words
zero information.

437
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:16,084
Get dressed.

438
00:47:16,695 --> 00:47:17,650
Why?

439
00:47:18,615 --> 00:47:20,412
Dress yourself and you'll know the.

440
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:29,170
Where are we going?

441
00:47:29,935 --> 00:47:33,007
You wanted to know where I live?
The show I'm going.

442
00:48:03,695 --> 00:48:04,445
Between.

443
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,728
This is where I live.

444
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:14,088
This is my house.
If you want to find ...

445
00:48:14,295 --> 00:48:15,808
I know where to find you.

446
00:48:16,015 --> 00:48:17,528
End of mystery.

447
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:23,964
You live here alone?

448
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,491
The maid is sick.

449
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:29,492
So, you live alone?

450
00:48:31,815 --> 00:48:33,214
My mother is in London.

451
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:35,774
I leave the morrow.

452
00:48:36,535 --> 00:48:37,888
I'll stay a month.

453
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:40,725
A month?

454
00:48:44,175 --> 00:48:45,767
This will be the last time.

455
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:48,450
Then
it will separate again.

456
00:48:49,335 --> 00:48:50,324
I return in a month.

457
00:48:50,935 --> 00:48:51,890
I promise.

458
00:48:52,895 --> 00:48:54,123
Completed Running away.

459
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,650
I want to live
with you forever.

460
00:49:02,055 --> 00:49:03,204
Because I love you.

461
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,894
If you like me ...

462
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,007
Of course I want from you.

463
00:49:29,215 --> 00:49:30,728
What do we do, my love?

464
00:49:31,575 --> 00:49:33,213
We go to a restaurant?

465
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,329
Or in bed?

466
00:49:37,255 --> 00:49:38,847
I have too many things to do.

467
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:39,885
All right.

468
00:49:40,735 --> 00:49:42,646
Tomorrow, I'll take you to the airport.

469
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,208
I hate the goodbyes.

470
00:49:46,095 --> 00:49:48,450
Do not complicate it.
Go now.

471
00:49:49,415 --> 00:49:51,929
Do as
if we see tomorrow.

472
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,766
I do not pretend,
but I'll try.

473
00:49:55,975 --> 00:49:58,364
Good.
I'll write you all the days.

474
00:49:58,655 --> 00:49:59,610
I swear.

475
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:02,612
I'll miss you, Nicole.

476
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:04,725
Many.

477
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:25,134
London, May 27

478
00:50:25,695 --> 00:50:29,654
My love, I'm just arrived
i miss you already.

479
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:33,051
From my window I see the park.

480
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:35,571
It's a beautiful day.

481
00:50:35,975 --> 00:50:37,169
But you're not there

482
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,084
and I am sad.

483
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,331
Send one every day.

484
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:50,614
I have the numbered
adhesive stamps on top.

485
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:52,134
Okay, I will.

486
00:50:52,335 --> 00:50:53,973
Talk about a break!

487
00:50:56,215 --> 00:50:58,683
- You are married in London?
- Not here.

488
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:01,291
- We got married yesterday.
- Really?

489
00:51:04,175 --> 00:51:06,325
- I wish them happiness.
- Thank you.

490
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:10,287
- I hope all goes well.
- Me too.

491
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,845
''I do not exist!''

492
00:51:58,055 --> 00:52:00,523
''I want
be one of your drawings!''

493
00:52:01,655 --> 00:52:04,374
Give! It's me who have found it!
I want to read it.

494
00:52:04,575 --> 00:52:06,088
''My life will change.''

495
00:52:06,295 --> 00:52:08,763
The first is''
I'm in love.''

496
00:52:09,455 --> 00:52:10,604
The Give Me!

497
00:52:11,335 --> 00:52:13,291
''I want
be one of his drawings!''

498
00:52:16,735 --> 00:52:17,804
The Give Me!

499
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:18,765
The You want?

500
00:52:18,975 --> 00:52:19,691
The Give Me!

501
00:52:22,615 --> 00:52:24,128
Farm Gate!

502
00:52:25,855 --> 00:52:26,685
What do you want?

503
00:52:27,575 --> 00:52:29,964
You're going to see
you do what you want!

504
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:33,486
- What is it?
- Kind of a bitch!

505
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:36,130
You expose your pussy
Place on Unita?

506
00:52:36,335 --> 00:52:37,563
''I'm in love!''

507
00:52:38,215 --> 00:52:39,409
''I want to be a picture!''

508
00:52:46,695 --> 00:52:48,253
Leave me!

509
00:53:09,695 --> 00:53:11,048
Help!

510
00:53:16,455 --> 00:53:17,934
You will see, damn!

511
00:53:25,215 --> 00:53:26,170
Bitch!

512
00:53:37,455 --> 00:53:40,606
I realized that I could
live without you.

513
00:53:40,935 --> 00:53:43,290
When you're not there
I have pleasure in anything.

514
00:53:43,775 --> 00:53:46,130
I lose the reason
if I do not know

515
00:53:46,335 --> 00:53:49,247
that you exist and that you don 't wait.

516
00:53:49,455 --> 00:53:51,844
Because you don 't wait,
is not it?

517
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,249
Keep the good.

518
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:49,809
Come, my dear, courage.

519
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:12,884
Glucose.

520
00:55:13,095 --> 00:55:15,006
We'll get him out of the coma.

521
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:21,295
I would like these days
are shorter.

522
00:55:21,495 --> 00:55:24,328
Don 't want it,
I do not give you my address.

523
00:55:24,535 --> 00:55:26,730
That is not
tempt you to join me.

524
00:55:26,935 --> 00:55:29,085
This division
is tested.

525
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:32,207
I want you to be sure
want to live with me.

526
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:35,771
As I'm sure she wants
spend my life with you.

527
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:39,207
Do you love me?
Me, I love you. Nicole.

528
00:56:04,055 --> 00:56:05,534
Do not worry, Clara.

529
00:56:05,975 --> 00:56:08,535
His condition is improving, believe me.

530
00:56:08,735 --> 00:56:10,532
But if I see the ...

531
00:56:11,055 --> 00:56:13,444
- It is too early.
- You will tell me?

532
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:14,690
Sure.

533
00:56:17,015 --> 00:56:18,414
Nicole Kiss for me.

534
00:57:38,015 --> 00:57:41,087
Some people
can not face reality.

535
00:57:42,695 --> 00:57:43,969
All injured.

536
00:57:44,655 --> 00:57:46,168
Nicole is the former.

537
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,013
A heightened sensitivity.

538
00:57:51,055 --> 00:57:54,127
- What is it?
- What difference does it make?

539
00:57:54,575 --> 00:57:58,045
If I told you that it is
manic-depressive

540
00:57:58,255 --> 00:58:01,008
or schizophrenic
or simply neurotic

541
00:58:01,215 --> 00:58:02,773
that's not the important thing.

542
00:58:07,855 --> 00:58:09,049
She is in coma

543
00:58:09,335 --> 00:58:10,484
under control.

544
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,812
On The fate of the coma
then it plunges into new,

545
00:58:14,015 --> 00:58:16,768
was awakened again,
and is it dived

546
00:58:16,975 --> 00:58:19,330
so, 30 or 40 times.

547
00:58:20,215 --> 00:58:23,093
We call
this treatment coma insulin.

548
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:25,365
It acts on the psyche of the patient.

549
00:58:26,855 --> 00:58:29,210
It is unclear why it stabilizes them,

550
00:58:29,895 --> 00:58:31,613
but it has beneficial effects.

551
00:58:31,815 --> 00:58:34,010
We hope to go to Nicole

552
00:58:34,215 --> 00:58:36,206
- Balance.
- This will be long?

553
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,134
Hard to say.
She had made great progress,

554
00:58:39,335 --> 00:58:41,724
She seemed almost healed.

555
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:45,766
We almost
The decided to leave out, then ...

556
00:58:45,975 --> 00:58:49,285
there about a month
Something happened there.

557
00:58:51,415 --> 00:58:53,485
You've said enough about me, thank you.

558
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:48,213
- Hello?
- Hello. Dr. Marino.

559
00:59:48,815 --> 00:59:50,328
Nicole is with you?

560
00:59:51,015 --> 00:59:53,006
So it does not go away.

561
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:56,173
It was released this morning
without my permission.

562
00:59:57,575 --> 00:59:59,611
Yes, I am sure
she will go home.

563
00:59:59,815 --> 01:00:01,294
No, I do have him say anything.

564
01:00:01,495 --> 01:00:03,611
She does not know that you know.

565
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,574
Do not ask me
what to do.

566
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:08,969
It's your problem.

567
01:00:09,295 --> 01:00:11,331
This choice is yours.

568
01:01:59,135 --> 01:01:59,726
Dino?

569
01:02:14,335 --> 01:02:15,654
Go away.

570
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:17,566
Go away.

571
01:02:48,455 --> 01:02:49,126
Where we going?

572
01:02:50,295 --> 01:02:52,763
In Afghanistan, China.
Where you want.

573
01:02:54,655 --> 01:02:56,168
Venice, alright with you?

574
01:02:57,415 --> 01:02:58,734
Here or elsewhere ...

575
01:03:01,895 --> 01:03:04,932
If you do not care,
we could have stayed home.

576
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:08,290
You do not understand
I wanted to escape?

577
01:03:09,455 --> 01:03:12,367
Excuse me, but I'm thinking.

578
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:15,133
That's how you see

579
01:03:15,415 --> 01:03:18,885
trip? You with your whiskey
and I who make the conversation?

580
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:20,574
It would be too selfish

581
01:03:20,775 --> 01:03:23,494
- Although it is tempting me!
- Please!

582
01:03:50,655 --> 01:03:51,724
One year ...

583
01:03:54,535 --> 01:03:55,172
What?

584
01:03:56,015 --> 01:03:56,606
Brazil.

585
01:03:57,935 --> 01:04:00,654
- It's been a year.
- It was a delight.

586
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:02,973
We ate too much papaya.

587
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,048
- We spend the afternoon here?
- You want to move?

588
01:04:12,855 --> 01:04:14,049
Good idea!

589
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:16,049
So, let's go.

590
01:04:16,935 --> 01:04:18,812
You're in my hands now.

591
01:04:19,015 --> 01:04:20,004
I know.

592
01:04:42,655 --> 01:04:43,974
I love you still.

593
01:05:27,775 --> 01:05:29,174
I'm sorry.

594
01:05:37,095 --> 01:05:38,767
Let, I'll drive.

595
01:06:16,575 --> 01:06:17,325
Val?

596
01:06:18,255 --> 01:06:19,529
Where are we?

597
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:22,254
End the trip.

598
01:06:25,015 --> 01:06:26,004
You want a coffee?

599
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:27,964
No, thank you.

600
01:06:29,175 --> 01:06:30,130
You hate me?

601
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:33,723
I hate lots of things,
but not you.

602
01:06:34,455 --> 01:06:36,571
What can I do
to thank you?

603
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:38,770
I'll send the note.

604
01:06:57,495 --> 01:06:58,769
Good luck.

605
01:07:33,615 --> 01:07:35,333
London, 1 June 3

606
01:07:35,695 --> 01:07:39,131
Dino, I do not know
if I succeed to explain,

607
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:40,973
but I'll try.

608
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:43,325
I met a man, Roberto.

609
01:07:44,015 --> 01:07:45,812
We fell in love.

610
01:07:47,655 --> 01:07:49,293
It's been love at first sight,

611
01:07:49,495 --> 01:07:51,611
as during a summer storm.

612
01:07:51,815 --> 01:07:53,294
We got married yesterday.

613
01:07:53,495 --> 01:07:56,692
Roberto Canadian
we leave tomorrow in Montreal.

614
01:07:56,895 --> 01:07:59,853
Do not try to find me.
Remember me

615
01:08:00,055 --> 01:08:03,411
and please,
do not hate me. Goodbye. Nicole.

616
01:09:13,735 --> 01:09:15,248
Since when you know The?

617
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:16,565
When?

618
01:09:19,095 --> 01:09:22,132
When you came home,
I hid myself.

619
01:09:23,255 --> 01:09:25,769
I know. I had understood.

620
01:09:27,495 --> 01:09:28,814
Poor Dino ...

621
01:09:30,255 --> 01:09:33,133
Then I wanted to flee you,
I'm gone.

622
01:09:36,175 --> 01:09:38,325
With that in which clothes,

623
01:09:38,535 --> 01:09:42,005
I was surprised that with you,
The other day.

624
01:09:42,855 --> 01:09:44,368
This dirty whore.

625
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:55,054
I love you, Nicole.

626
01:09:56,535 --> 01:09:57,854
This is unfortunate,

627
01:09:58,535 --> 01:10:00,730
because I do not love you anymore.

628
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:03,054
Yes, I remember.

629
01:10:04,015 --> 01:10:07,894
You like Roberto now
one you married.

630
01:10:09,015 --> 01:10:10,084
I lied.

631
01:10:10,295 --> 01:10:11,250
Why?

632
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:13,491
Because I am a liar!

633
01:10:14,895 --> 01:10:17,693
I do not know how to tell
I do not love you anymore.

634
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:18,805
You love me!

635
01:10:19,095 --> 01:10:20,164
It's not true!

636
01:10:22,295 --> 01:10:23,250
Listen.

637
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,774
Come live with me.

638
01:10:27,015 --> 01:10:30,485
Do not tell me that,
while jostling in my head.

639
01:10:30,695 --> 01:10:32,970
- Go away, please.
- Not without you.

640
01:10:33,255 --> 01:10:34,893
The Thou must understand.

641
01:10:35,175 --> 01:10:37,086
You can not leave me alone!

642
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:49,130
You're as crazy as me.

643
01:10:51,575 --> 01:10:52,166
The I think.

644
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,894
But you've never seen
when I scream,

645
01:10:59,095 --> 01:11:01,131
when I do not recognize anyone anymore

646
01:11:01,735 --> 01:11:03,885
when I hallucinate.

647
01:11:04,575 --> 01:11:05,849
The I bear.

648
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:10,607
Sometime. Sometimes
I do not even know who I am!

649
01:11:11,495 --> 01:11:14,293
What took you
to love a girl like me?

650
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:17,806
If you want to know if it works,
we must try.

651
01:11:19,695 --> 01:11:21,128
You do not know what you say.

652
01:11:22,935 --> 01:11:24,448
You can help me?

653
01:11:26,055 --> 01:11:26,931
Not sure.

654
01:11:27,655 --> 01:11:29,486
Life is dangerous.

655
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:31,330
Like Love.

656
01:11:36,775 --> 01:11:38,049
Like Love.

657
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,128
What time is it?

658
01:13:01,935 --> 01:13:03,163
8am, 9am, who knows?

659
01:13:03,455 --> 01:13:05,605
- From the morning or evening?
- I will see.

660
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:20,686
Evening.

661
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:23,884
You hungry?

662
01:13:25,855 --> 01:13:27,004
You want to eat here?

663
01:14:34,055 --> 01:14:36,853
No need to get excited,
we have already said enough.

664
01:14:37,775 --> 01:14:40,767
I know you're in New York
and I'm in Paris ...

665
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:44,608
Do not worry,
I see Charlie tonight.

666
01:14:44,815 --> 01:14:46,328
I tell him. Hello.

667
01:14:52,615 --> 01:14:53,570
Who was that?

668
01:14:54,455 --> 01:14:56,411
It is not worth the trouble to speak.

669
01:14:58,495 --> 01:14:59,894
She was a woman, eh?

670
01:15:01,535 --> 01:15:02,490
What woman?

671
01:15:03,335 --> 01:15:04,734
It was for my work.

672
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:07,489
I understand, will.

673
01:15:15,735 --> 01:15:17,327
You do not understand.

674
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:21,290
There is only one woman
in my life.

675
01:15:21,495 --> 01:15:22,450
And it's you.

676
01:15:22,975 --> 01:15:23,851
Is that clear?

677
01:15:27,655 --> 01:15:28,849
No, please.

678
01:15:52,655 --> 01:15:53,610
Come in.

679
01:16:06,535 --> 01:16:07,285
Put it There.

680
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:32,764
I must
as if I had not seen?

681
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:49,447
When you leave Paris?

682
01:16:49,975 --> 01:16:51,567
As soon as I bore myself.

683
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,892
You have a beautiful dress.

684
01:16:54,095 --> 01:16:56,006
That's why I fly!

685
01:17:10,255 --> 01:17:12,166
There is so that you hide!

686
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:15,053
- Hi!
- Hi, Charlie.

687
01:17:15,855 --> 01:17:18,323
So? You know Danielle?

688
01:17:18,535 --> 01:17:21,368
- Yes. How are you?
- Well, do you?

689
01:17:21,575 --> 01:17:22,610
It is time to go.

690
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,567
I'll join you in a moment.

691
01:17:25,055 --> 01:17:27,489
- Are you staying long?
- I'm leaving in three days.

692
01:17:27,695 --> 01:17:29,174
London and New York.

693
01:17:29,615 --> 01:17:31,333
Want
I convey a message?

694
01:17:31,535 --> 01:17:34,003
Tell them to calm down,
I will deliver on time.

695
01:17:34,735 --> 01:17:37,295
- The book comes out at Christmas.
- The Harry told me.

696
01:17:39,095 --> 01:17:40,813
Looking for who? A girl?

697
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:43,411
Yes, my friend. It has disappeared.

698
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:47,974
Claude had to take him up there
watch the documentary.

699
01:17:48,575 --> 01:17:51,647
He has reported from the Middle East.
It's fantastic.

700
01:17:52,095 --> 01:17:53,494
You know Claude!

701
01:17:53,695 --> 01:17:55,731
Yes, I know the. See you later.

702
01:17:56,735 --> 01:17:57,611
Have fun.

703
01:18:41,015 --> 01:18:42,414
There! Now!

704
01:19:07,575 --> 01:19:09,088
Come, let us go.

705
01:19:10,935 --> 01:19:11,685
Let's go.

706
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,810
That's better.

707
01:19:23,455 --> 01:19:26,811
Still with me,
and I will not be afraid.

708
01:19:28,175 --> 01:19:30,131
I will not be afraid of anything.

709
01:19:31,615 --> 01:19:34,368
I wish there
more than you and me.

710
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,174
Just two of us.

711
01:19:39,495 --> 01:19:41,565
I want to go to the house.

712
01:19:43,095 --> 01:19:44,892
I will stand by you, my darling.

713
01:19:49,935 --> 01:19:51,368
We go to the house.

714
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:01,165
It's good to see you!
I can take you home.

715
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:04,572
- Are you happy?
- Yes, very. Happiness is.

716
01:20:17,935 --> 01:20:20,768
- There will be enough space?
- Yes, I think.

717
01:20:22,895 --> 01:20:25,534
- Where I put my clothes?
- Wherever you want.

718
01:20:25,735 --> 01:20:27,373
You're at home here.

719
01:20:28,055 --> 01:20:30,569
I think I'll be happy.

720
01:20:34,655 --> 01:20:36,054
Sure you'll be the.

721
01:20:47,695 --> 01:20:49,014
Only me.

722
01:20:49,215 --> 01:20:51,524
- Your new tenant.
- Leave on.

723
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:55,929
- Are you going out?
- Yes, I go to the beach.

724
01:20:57,815 --> 01:20:59,771
- You put me in color?
- Flaming.

725
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,694
For my Beauty
spring from the board!

726
01:21:05,335 --> 01:21:06,290
I am full of energy.

727
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:10,412
The coffee is on the stove,
you just turn it on

728
01:21:10,695 --> 01:21:12,048
and wait until the water boils.

729
01:21:14,655 --> 01:21:15,724
While you wait,

730
01:21:16,015 --> 01:21:17,607
The kitchen puts a bit.

731
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:19,131
Yes, sir.

732
01:23:38,095 --> 01:23:38,971
Go away.

733
01:24:18,615 --> 01:24:19,684
Go away!

734
01:24:21,215 --> 01:24:22,045
Go away!

735
01:24:29,575 --> 01:24:32,135
- Come quickly! They scare me!
- What is it?

736
01:24:32,815 --> 01:24:33,964
Send them away, I beg you!

737
01:24:34,175 --> 01:24:36,848
- Help me!
- But what? There is nothing.

738
01:24:37,135 --> 01:24:38,170
Cockroaches!

739
01:24:38,455 --> 01:24:40,093
- Everywhere!
- There is none.

740
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,286
- Believe me.
- Make the go.

741
01:24:42,575 --> 01:24:45,043
- I beg you.
- Everything is fine.

742
01:24:46,015 --> 01:24:46,686
Where they are,

743
01:24:46,895 --> 01:24:47,645
now?

744
01:24:47,855 --> 01:24:49,254
It's everywhere.

745
01:24:52,135 --> 01:24:52,965
On the floor.

746
01:24:56,535 --> 01:24:58,287
Yes, I am the hunt.

747
01:25:01,535 --> 01:25:03,491
My God!
I have in the hair!

748
01:25:07,975 --> 01:25:09,294
They are Here.

749
01:25:20,695 --> 01:25:22,094
Caimi, my love.

750
01:25:24,095 --> 01:25:25,369
They are Here.

751
01:25:27,735 --> 01:25:29,054
There are more.

752
01:25:29,255 --> 01:25:31,450
I'm still in the hair.

753
01:25:32,935 --> 01:25:34,334
The I still feel.

754
01:25:34,535 --> 01:25:35,490
But no.

755
01:25:37,455 --> 01:25:38,604
There is none.

756
01:25:38,815 --> 01:25:40,214
There never has been.

757
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,448
But I have the felt.

758
01:25:42,655 --> 01:25:44,293
- For real.
- I know ...

759
01:25:45,135 --> 01:25:46,534
It's over now.

760
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:50,210
You have beautiful hair.

761
01:25:51,495 --> 01:25:52,132
If long.

762
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:57,606
I hope that this is
as a temporary crisis.

763
01:25:58,215 --> 01:26:00,490
She takes medication
regularly?

764
01:26:00,695 --> 01:26:02,208
Yes, I think.

765
01:26:03,895 --> 01:26:07,046
Well ...
And for your wedding

766
01:26:08,255 --> 01:26:10,405
- You set the date?
- Not yet.

767
01:26:11,495 --> 01:26:12,166
Soon.

768
01:26:12,455 --> 01:26:15,731
It's a good idea.
This marriage could help.

769
01:26:15,935 --> 01:26:19,371
That could make him
stability.

770
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:21,249
I hope so.

771
01:26:22,615 --> 01:26:24,526
It's worth a try, right?

772
01:26:24,735 --> 01:26:26,771
Yes, it is very important.

773
01:26:29,815 --> 01:26:32,568
You said to Nicole
you come see me?

774
01:26:32,775 --> 01:26:35,608
She was sleeping when I left.
It was cairn.

775
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:38,204
It is better
that you're waking up.

776
01:26:38,415 --> 01:26:39,814
Call me if needed.

777
01:26:40,015 --> 01:26:42,688
- At any time.
- Thanks, of course.

778
01:27:04,215 --> 01:27:06,649
Enough Enough

779
01:27:08,255 --> 01:27:10,086
I'm exhausted!

780
01:27:15,815 --> 01:27:16,884
Enough

781
01:27:23,335 --> 01:27:24,654
What's up?

782
01:27:25,815 --> 01:27:27,134
Caimi now!

783
01:27:27,335 --> 01:27:28,609
Stop the bell!

784
01:27:33,295 --> 01:27:35,251
- I'm Doing.
- The Stop!

785
01:27:48,135 --> 01:27:50,603
I beg you, do the quiet.

786
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:52,488
I beg you!

787
01:27:53,055 --> 01:27:54,852
Make the stop!

788
01:28:10,975 --> 01:28:12,693
I'll go away.

789
01:28:44,455 --> 01:28:46,411
I just know
she was going home.

790
01:28:47,015 --> 01:28:48,892
There is about three hours.

791
01:28:50,055 --> 01:28:51,693
No, she was well.

792
01:28:53,215 --> 01:28:55,331
Wait, I think it is Here.

793
01:28:55,535 --> 01:28:57,253
Okay, I'll tell him.

794
01:29:00,895 --> 01:29:01,884
It was Clara.

795
01:29:02,775 --> 01:29:04,766
I have not gone home.

796
01:29:06,695 --> 01:29:09,004
- You want to know where I was?
- Yes.

797
01:29:24,055 --> 01:29:24,851
Good God ...

798
01:29:25,495 --> 01:29:27,565
- It's you that I have said.
- Me?

799
01:29:27,775 --> 01:29:28,366
You said

800
01:29:28,575 --> 01:29:30,611
- They were too Long.
- No.

801
01:29:30,895 --> 01:29:33,409
I said they were
Long and beautiful.

802
01:29:36,215 --> 01:29:37,250
I disgust you?

803
01:29:38,095 --> 01:29:40,051
- Tell Him.
- Not at all.

804
01:29:41,535 --> 01:29:44,891
It is the element of surprise,
let me get used to it.

805
01:29:45,895 --> 01:29:47,931
Answer honestly.
I please you

806
01:29:48,215 --> 01:29:49,170
like that?

807
01:29:56,735 --> 01:29:58,248
You always like.

808
01:30:00,015 --> 01:30:00,970
It's true.

809
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:04,127
I think you're very sexy.

810
01:30:06,255 --> 01:30:07,131
Really?

811
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,290
I swear.

812
01:30:09,975 --> 01:30:11,727
So prove to me.

813
01:30:12,895 --> 01:30:14,123
Let's get to bed.

814
01:30:16,255 --> 01:30:19,611
Do not tempt me,
I should finish Beauty.

815
01:30:27,575 --> 01:30:29,611
I'll join you later, OK?

816
01:32:40,735 --> 01:32:42,487
Here Earth, to you.

817
01:32:44,735 --> 01:32:47,090
It's you who have taken?
The Tell me.

818
01:32:50,695 --> 01:32:51,525
What?

819
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:53,764
Letter.

820
01:32:56,215 --> 01:32:57,364
What Letter?

821
01:32:58,255 --> 01:32:59,893
Newsletter Roberto.

822
01:33:00,615 --> 01:33:02,890
The one he sent me to London.

823
01:33:06,095 --> 01:33:07,767
Roberto does not exist.

824
01:33:09,135 --> 01:33:11,603
It's you who have invented
remember.

825
01:33:12,575 --> 01:33:13,974
Do not touch me.

826
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:36,725
London, September 25.

827
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:39,889
Nicole, I can not
live without you.

828
01:33:40,735 --> 01:33:42,134
I come for you.

829
01:33:42,335 --> 01:33:46,374
When we are together,
there will be neither winter, nor rain,

830
01:33:46,575 --> 01:33:48,964
nor snow, nor cold.

831
01:33:49,175 --> 01:33:51,131
Nothing but the sun.

832
01:34:13,015 --> 01:34:14,004
Good morning.

833
01:34:17,975 --> 01:34:20,011
You've worked all night?

834
01:34:20,455 --> 01:34:21,649
More or less.

835
01:34:23,895 --> 01:34:25,965
It is you who put me in bed?

836
01:34:26,175 --> 01:34:28,166
You were asleep on the couch.

837
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:29,524
How do you feeling?

838
01:34:31,095 --> 01:34:32,494
Perfectly.

839
01:34:33,175 --> 01:34:36,326
There was the sun,
it's a beautiful day.

840
01:34:41,015 --> 01:34:44,610
I prayed so that there
the sun today. He is Here

841
01:34:44,895 --> 01:34:46,169
just for me.

842
01:34:46,575 --> 01:34:48,770
I'll go
enjoy on the beach.

843
01:34:49,215 --> 01:34:50,364
I'll come.

844
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:53,125
Do not come.

845
01:34:54,215 --> 01:34:55,045
You're tired.

846
01:34:57,015 --> 01:34:58,084
I must rest.

847
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:00,809
It does not matter
I want to go with you.

848
01:35:01,495 --> 01:35:02,325
I'm out.

849
01:35:04,255 --> 01:35:05,768
Do what you want ...

850
01:35:59,975 --> 01:36:01,044
Thank you, Tony.

851
01:36:03,455 --> 01:36:06,652
Who would have thought it?
There was four months, on The recovered,

852
01:36:06,975 --> 01:36:08,374
and now ...

853
01:36:08,575 --> 01:36:10,486
There was barely four months.

854
01:36:11,215 --> 01:36:14,173
When you asked me
if I knew the ...

855
01:36:14,895 --> 01:36:18,092
I wanted to tell you something,
but I dared not.

856
01:36:18,735 --> 01:36:19,690
What?

857
01:36:19,895 --> 01:36:22,409
In your place,
I paid attention.

858
01:36:23,095 --> 01:36:25,563
- Must live dangerously.
- It's true!
